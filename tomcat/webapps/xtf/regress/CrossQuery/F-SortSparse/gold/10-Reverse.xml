         <title>The Problems of a Political Animal: Community, Justice, and Conflict in Aristotelian Political Thought</title>
         <creator>Bernard R. Yack</creator>

         <subject>Political Theory</subject>
         <subject>Social and Political Thought</subject>
         <subject>Social Theory</subject>
         <description>A bold new interpretation of Aristotelian thought is central to Bernard Yack's provocative new book. He shows that for Aristotle, community is a conflict-ridden fact of everyday life, as well as an ideal of social harmony and <snippet rank="1">integration. From political justice and <hit>
                  <term>the</term>
               </hit> rule of law to class struggle and</snippet> moral conflict, Yack maintains <snippet rank="2">that Aristotle intended to explain <hit>
                  <term>the</term>
               </hit> conditions of everyday political life,</snippet> not just, <snippet rank="3">as most commentators assume, to represent <hit>
                  <term>the</term>
               </hit> hypothetical achievements of an</snippet> idealistic "best regime."By showing how Aristotelian ideas can provide new insight into our own political life, Yack makes a valuable contribution to contemporary discourse and debate. His work will excite interest among a wide range of social, moral, and political theorists.</description>
