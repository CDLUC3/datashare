    <description>T.V. Reed urges an affiliation between literary theory and political action - and
      between political action and literary theory. What can the "new literary theory" learn from
      "new social movements"; and what can social activists learn from poststructuralism, new
      historicism, feminist theory, and neomarxism?In strikingly new interpretations of texts in
      four different genres - Agee and Evans's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, Ellison's Invisible
      Man, Mailer's Armies of the Night, and the ecofeminist Women's Pentagon Actions of the early
      1980s - Reed shows how reading literary texts for their political strategies and reading
      political movements as texts can help us overcome certain rhetorical traps that have
      undermined American efforts to combat racism, sexism, and economic inequality.</description>
