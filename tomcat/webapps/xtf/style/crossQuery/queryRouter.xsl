      This stylesheet implements a simple switching mechanism, allowing one to
      set up multiple distinct crossQuery domains, each with its own query parser
      and associated stylesheets.
      
      As shipped, there are two domains, "default" and "oai", which supports OAI 
      harvesting of your collections
