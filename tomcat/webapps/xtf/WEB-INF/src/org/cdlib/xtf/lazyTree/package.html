<p>The &quot;lazy tree&quot; mechanism speeds document processing requests by 
  storing a binary document representation on disk and only loading the actual 
  nodes used in a given transformation. Most requests only use a small part of 
  any given document, so this results in a large time savings. At all times, we 
  maintain the illusion that the entire tree is in RAM, even though most of it 
  is secretly left on disk.</p>
<p>In addition to a binary representation of each node, the disk file also contains 
  a cache for each xsl:key definition that is processed. Without this cache, every 
  time a key was used the entire tree would have to be loaded from disk, defeating 
  the purpose of the LazyTree.</p>
<p>Given a source XML document, a persistent disk file can be created using <a href="LazyTreeBuilder.html">LazyTreeBuilder</a>. 
  The same class can be used later to load that document back from disk (or rather, 
  to load the root node of that document; other nodes will be loaded as needed 
  to maintain the illusion that the whole tree is in memory.)</p>
<p>Additionally, this package supports annotating the disk file with TextEngine 
  search results; see the <a href="SearchTree.html">SearchTree</a> class for more 
  information.</p>
<p>Where possible, the code here makes use of Michael Kay's Saxon code, and implements 
  Saxon's NodeInfo interface to integrate seamlessly and speedily with XSLT processing.</p>
