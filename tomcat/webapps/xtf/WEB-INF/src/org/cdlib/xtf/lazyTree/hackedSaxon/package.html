<p>Saxon's &quot;tiny tree&quot; implementation is perfect for loading an entire 
  document into RAM, assinging numbers to everything and placing them in handy 
  arrays; perfect, that is, except for the fact that all these handy variables 
  are marked 'private'. The classes in this package are almost verbatim from the 
  Saxon distribution, with two exceptions: (1) many members changed to 'public', 
  and (2) text is accumulated to disk instead of in RAM.</p>
<p>XTF's &quot;lazy tree&quot; uses the tiny tree to load the source document, 
  then references the arrays to build the persistent output file.</p>
