<p>This package provides two different caching mechanisms, which are used throughout 
  XTF to speed access to commonly used items. The two types of caches are <a href="SimpleCache.html">SimpleCache</a>, 
  to which one simply adds items to cache, and <a href="GeneratingCache.html">GeneratingCache</a> 
  in which one queries for a requested item and it's generated if it doesn't yet 
  exist. </p>
<p>Both types of caches support the ability to expire entries on a least-recently-used 
  basis, maintaining a limit on the number of entries, maximum age of an entry, 
  or both.</p>
<p>Added to this is a fairly sophisticated dependency mechanism, where one cache 
  entry can depend on one (or many) <a href="FileDependency.html">FileDependencies</a>; 
  if any file changes, the entry is thrown out. Likewise, a cache entry can depend 
  on another cache entry using a <a href="CacheDependency.html">CacheDependency</a>.</p>
