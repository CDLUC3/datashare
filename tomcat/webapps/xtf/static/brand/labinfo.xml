		<description>The mission of the Center for the Imaging of Neuroregenerative Diseases (CIND) is to develop new treatments which slow progression and will ultimately prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gulf war illness, epilepsy, depression, and other conditions associated with nerve loss in the brain. Our focus is brain imaging, especially with MRI including structural MRI, perfusion MRI, diffusion tensor/spectral MRI, susceptibility weighted MRI, MR spectroscopy and MR spectroscopic imaging.</description>

	    <campus>University of California, Davis</campus>
		<description>Research in my laboratory focuses on biodemography: an emerging division of classical demography that brings life table techniques, mortality models, experimental systems, and comparative methods to bear on questions concerned with the fundamental determinants of mortality, longevity, aging and life span. I am interested in insect mortality dynamics, mortality trajectories, and the evolution of life span and extended longevity. I am also interested in aging with special emphasis on the oldest individuals in a population, and with studying the behavioral and social components of life span and aging. The evolution of social organization as a component of life history is an important research interest in my laboratory. While many of our studies are on captive populations, we are moving into the study of aging in nature; attempting to determine mortality dynamics in field conditions.</description>
